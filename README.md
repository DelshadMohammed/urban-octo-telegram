# Project Title: Urban-Octo-Telegram

## Project Description:

This project was to improve the accessability to the code created by the previous developers also refactoring the code to represent a logical flow. I did this by improving the semantic text allowing other developers who undertake the project to better understand where crucial elements relating to the project are placed and a making it easy for other developers to follow a rational flow.
